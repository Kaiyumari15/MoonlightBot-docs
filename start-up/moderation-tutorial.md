# Moderation Tutorial

This guide will give you the basic information needed to moderate your Discord server with MoonlightBot. It features a list of commands and how they work, complete with their options, infractions, and log information to help you better understand how to use them

## Command Options

These are options you may use while executing moderation commands. You can find a more in-depth guide about options in the [arguments page](/start-up/arguments.md)

![A list of example options in a mute command](/.gitbook/assets/MuteArguments.png "Options Example")

- `user`: The user to execute the moderation action on
- `reason`: The reason for which you are taking the action, useful for record keeping. The reason shows up in infractions, logs, and notifications from the bot
- `notify`: Whether or not the bot will message the user after the command is executed, as shown below

- `no-infraction`: Whether or not the command will count towards the user's infractions

{% hint style="info" %}
If both the `notify` and `no-infraction` options are true, the target will **not** be notified in order to prevent harassment via MoonlightBot
{% endhint %}

- `duration`: The amount of time for which the action taken will last. For information on the format used, refer to the [options page](/start-up/arguments.md#Durations)
- `remove-roles`: Exclusive to the mute commands, this option will remove all of the user's roles except the muterole if true. This is to facilitate the effectiveness of the mute command

{% hint style="info" %}
You can configure MoonlightBot to ban someone if they send a message while they have the mute role by running the command `/config settings mute-evasion-ban:True`. This is a helpful backup if the mute isn't working as intended
{% endhint %}

- `role`: The role to assign/remove in a role command

## Moderation Tools

These features help ensure a seamless moderation experience with MoonlightBot

### User IDs

A user ID is a string of numbers that is unique to a Discord account. Unlike usernames, the user ID cannot be changed, which is useful for various purposes, such as locating a user (even if they have changed their username to avoid detection) and executing commands for a user who has left the server. A great place to use IDs is the search bar, located at the top of the page.
![The search bar at the top of the page](/.gitbook/assets/searchBar.jpg "Search Bar")
To access user IDs, it is recommended that you enable [Developer Mode](/advanced/developer-mode.md), but MoonlightBot also displays user IDs next to usernames in command outputs

### Infractions

Infractions help staff members keep track of a user's bad conduct and make informed decisions while moderating. This is a versatile tool with multiple subcommands to assist your moderation needs

![An example of the Infractions Summary command](/.gitbook/assets/InfractionsExample.png "Infractions Example")

- [**`/infractions summary`**](/moderation-commands/infractions.md#summary): This command shows the 3 most recent infractions, and the infraction count of each different infraction type. If a tempban/mute/timeout is active, the command will show that as well
- [**`/infractions detailed`**](/moderation-commands/infractions.md#detailed): This command shows the infraction type, user affected, moderator who enforced it, reason, and date created
- [**`/infractions reason`**](/moderation-commands/infractions.md#reason): This command displays the reason given to the infraction, and allows you to edit it
- [**`/infractions search`**](/moderation-commands/infractions.md#search): This command allows you to see a list of infractions within given parameters, such as the moderator who executed them
- [**`/infractions delete`**](/moderation-commands/infractions.md#delete): This command deletes a specified infraction

### Logs

When moderators execute an action such as a warn, MoonlightBot will send a message in the designated logs channel in order to keep track of moderation events. For more information on setting up logs, refer to the logs section of the [main page](/README.md)

## Commands

All the commands listed can be found in the "Moderation Commands" and "Role Management Commands" categories

### Ban/Kick

- [**`/kick`**](/moderation-commands/kick.md): This command removes a user from the server, but they are able to rejoin if they have an invite
- [**`/ban`**](/moderation-commands/ban.md): This command kicks a user from the server and prohibits them from rejoining
- [**`/tempban`**](/moderation-commands/tempban.md): This command temporarily bans a user for a set amount of time
- [**`/softban`**](/moderation-commands/softban.md): This command bans a user then immediately unbans them. Though similar to the kick command, this command deletes the user's messages (useful for cleaning up spam)
- [**`/unban`**](/moderation-commands/unban.md): This command unbans a user from the server, allowing them to rejoin (if they have an invite)
  
### Mute
