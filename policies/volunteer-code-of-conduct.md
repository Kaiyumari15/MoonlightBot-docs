# Volunteer Code of Conduct

We allow users to participate in volunteering to keep our services running and appreciate your commitment to help us. To ensure that our management remains a positive and productive environment, we have established this Volunteer Code of Conduct.

**By submitting a volunteer application or participating in any of our community programs, you affirm that you have fully read, understood, and agree to be bound by this policy, as written and unconditionally.**

Last updated: June 27th, 2024

## 1 - Submission of Applications

1. Applications must be submitted in good faith, providing accurate and truthful information
2. You must not submit applications/interviews that are frivolous, with the intent of wasting reviewers' time, generate a large volume of applications, exploit or circumvent any technical or procedural fallacy in the process, or misrepresent your fulfillment of position requirements.
3. You must not offer bribes, trade goods, threaten reviewers or other volunteers to access a volunteer position.
4. By applying for a volunteer position, you agree that we will conduct background checks based on any public and/or available information that you provided, whether directly or indirectly, and verify your ability and willingness to properly participate in the activities.
5. The usage of "Generative Artificial Intelligence" (e.g ChatGPT or other Large Language Models) in volunteer applications is prohibited.

### 2 - Withdrawal of Applications

1. Withdrawing an application must be done through written, timely and unambiguous notice sent to your designated point of contact.
2. We may reject applications that do not receive a response within a certain time.
3. You must take no action that creates ambiguity or doubt about your interest in following up with your candidature or application.
4. We deserve full discretion in determining whether actions you took constitute implied intent of withdrawal, and issue penalties accordingly.

## 3 - Healthy Communication

1. As a volunteer you officially represent Moonlight Labs; engage in respectful and constructive communication with fellow volunteers, Staff, and community members, both inside our premises and outside.
2. Avoid using offensive or derogatory language and refrain from engaging in personal attacks or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other protected characteristic. Volunteers must not take any action that would undermine the good name or misrepresent Moonlight Labs, MoonlightBot or their activities.

## 4 - Inactivity/break Notices and Resignation

1. We understand that circumstances may change, and you may need to resign from your position. We want to assure you that you have the freedom to resign without any penalty by sending a written notice to your designated point of contact. We offer resignations immediately, no questions asked, and remain entitled to some benefits and participation rewards as long as you follow this code of conduct and show an understanding of our necessity to have deadlines followed and all volunteers accounted for.
2. Sudden and prolonged inactivity without communication is not acceptable within our volunteer programs. We rely on active and engaged volunteers to fulfill our mission effectively. If you anticipate or experience a period of inactivity, or you feel the need to take a break, we kindly request that you notify your designated point of contact in advance. Open and transparent communication is crucial in maintaining a productive and cohesive volunteer team.
3. You agree that we may employ means deemed appropriate to verify your compliance with this code of conduct.

## 5 - Liability for Damages and Enforcement

1. Volunteers are responsible for their actions while participating in programs.
2. Understand that you are to be held liable for any damages, delays, emotional distress or other consequences caused to our service or any associated systems or personnel as a result of your intentional or negligent actions.
3. Failure to comply with this Volunteer Code of Conduct may result in punitive action, including warnings, temporary suspension, termination from the volunteer program with forfeiture of recognition and benefits or other penalties described in the Acceptable Use Policy.

## 6 - Changes to this Code of Conduct

We may update this Volunteer Code of Conduct from time to time. We will try to notify you of any changes through our official channels. It is your responsibility to review this Volunteer Code of Conduct periodically for any updates or changes.
