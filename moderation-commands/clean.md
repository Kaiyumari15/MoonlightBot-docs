# clean

This command deletes a large amount of messages from a channel, optionally limited by specifying some deletion criteria. Criteria are options that distinguish messages such as those that contain a specific phrase. Using multiple criteria will narrow the selection to only messages that fit all of them. Up to 100 messages can be deleted in a single execution of the command, and only those sent within the last 14 days.
