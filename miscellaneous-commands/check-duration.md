# check-duration

This command is equivalent to the previous versionâ€™s `/status` command. It allows you to see how long you can set a temporary action.

If you [vote for MoonlightBot](../support-our-work/upvote-moonlightbot.md), purchase a [premium subscription](../support-our-work/premium.md), [join the support server](https://discord.com/invite/hNQWVVC) (which besides support you can also read news and changelogs, participate in [volunteer programs](../support-our-work/volunteering.md), giveaways, meet the person who wrote this and the developer, among more), or if you started using MoonlightBot less than 7 days ago, the durations for how long you can set a temporary action to last increases. Refer to the chart to see all available bonuses:
