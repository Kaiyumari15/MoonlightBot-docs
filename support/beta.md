# Beta

MoonlightBot beta is a public beta version of the bot that let users who want the upcoming features be able to try out these features before they get publicly released to MoonlightBot. Beta also gets bug fixes early.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To keep MoonlightBot beta in a server, any member with manage server permissions must be in the support server, to act as a point of contact for us. Failing to meet this requirement at any time will result in an automatic removal of the bot.
{% endhint %}

## Debunking common misconceptions and Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I have to keep both stable and beta if I want to use it?

No, you don't need to clutter your server with two almost identical bots. The server administrator can use the `/transfer data` command to transfer data from any other version of MoonlightBot to Beta. Transferrals are free and instant.

### I have a fear it may break from a moment to another

Before any major breaking change is sent to beta, it's carefully reviewed in another test bot by both developers and volunteers. The chance of bugs is pretty low, and you can always [report bugs](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC) for them to be fixed quickly, for a greater good.

![A simple explanation of how beta works. If a bug is not found in beta, it will appear on stable, and you'll encounter it sooner or later anyways. Better fix it while it's still hot.](<../.gitbook/assets/DifferenceBetweenBetaAndStable.png>)

### I don't want to lose all my temproles, infractions and server configuration

If you choose to transfer your data, you won't! You can seamlessly switch to beta by [transferring your data as described above](#will-i-have-to-keep-both-stable-and-beta-if-i-want-to-use-it).

### I don't comply with the requirement of having at least a server admin in MoonlightBot's support server

Having MoonlightBot beta in a server requires someone with "Manage server" permission to be in the support server, so the Staff can have a point of contact to refer that server by.

### I have no time/I don't know how to look for bugs

No problem! You are not required to actively find bugs, rather, use the features you'd normally use and report any bugs you may find.
