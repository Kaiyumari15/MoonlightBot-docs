# Beta

MoonlightBot beta is a public beta version of the bot. It receives new features and bug fixes before they're pushed to the main version. By using beta, you can contribute to the development of MoonlightBot by finding bugs that slipped past our testing team and reporting them to the developers, so that they don't hinder the service for users of the main bot.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To keep MoonlightBot beta in a server, any member with manage server permissions must be in the support server, to act as a point of contact for us. Failing to meet this requirement at any time will result in an automatic removal of the bot.
{% endhint %}

## How to get MoonlightBot beta

1. Join [MoonlightBot's support server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC)
2. Go to the **#get-beta** channel (the link above will take you directly)
3. Click on the invite link, then proceed to invite it like any other bot
4. If you've used the main version and want to transfer your data, run `/transfer data`

## Common Misconceptions and Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I have to keep both main and beta in my server?

No, you don't need to clutter your server with two almost identical bots. The server administrator can use the `/transfer data` command to transfer data from any other version of MoonlightBot to Beta. Transferrals are free and instant.

### I fear it may break from time to time

Before any major breaking change is sent to beta, it's carefully reviewed in another test bot by both developers and [volunteers](/volunteering.md#tester). The beta version differs from this test bot in that beta is used to gather data on real-world usage and minor bugs, where test is used for heavy debugging and major corrections. Due to this, the chance of bugs on beta is pretty low. If you do find a bug, you are encouraged to [report it](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC) so that it can be fixed quickly.

### I don't want to lose all my temproles, infractions and server configuration

If you choose to transfer your data, you won't! You can seamlessly switch to beta by [transferring your data as described above](#will-i-have-to-keep-both-main-and-beta-if-i-want-to-use-it).

### I don't comply with the requirement of having at least a server admin in MoonlightBot's support server

Having MoonlightBot beta in a server requires someone with "Manage server" permission to be in the support server, so the Staff can have a point of contact to refer that server by.

### I have no time/I don't know how to look for bugs

No problem! You are not required to actively find bugs. Just use the features you'd normally use and report any bugs you may find.
